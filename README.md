##🏠 Home Page Overview (Built with React.js)
The Home Page of this project is developed using React.js, leveraging component-based architecture to create a clean, responsive, and modular UI. Each section of the homepage is encapsulated in reusable components, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.

🚀 Key Features
Component-Based Design:
Every section like Header, Hero, Services, Packages, Reviews, Offers, and Footer is developed as a separate React component.

Reusable UI Elements:
Buttons, cards, and layout elements are reused across the application using props and composition, ensuring consistency.

Routing and Navigation:
Implemented using react-router-dom for smooth navigation between pages or sections.

Responsive Design:
The layout is mobile-friendly and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using CSS media queries or utility libraries like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap (if used).

State Management (if applicable):
Local state or context API can be used for dynamic features like modal visibility, form handling, or conditional rendering.
