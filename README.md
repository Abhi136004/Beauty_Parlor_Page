Each section (Header, Hero, Services, Packages, Reviews, Offers, Footer) is built as a separate React component.

♻️ Reusable UI Elements:
Buttons, cards, and layout blocks are modular and customizable using props.

🔄 Routing and Navigation:
Handled with react-router-dom for smooth transitions between views or sections.

📱 Responsive Design:
Fully mobile-friendly using modern CSS techniques or libraries like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap (if used).
